# AtliQ Hardware Sales Data Analytic
## The big problem
AtLiq Hardware is a computer hardware manufacturer in India. Bhavin Patel is AtliQ's Sales Diretor and he had noticed the declining in sales of the company laterly. He asked regional managers for the sales data and, in return, he received spreadsheets without any useful insight information. So he sent a request to the data team to help him answer few questions.
1. Revenue breakdown by cities.
2. Revenue breakdown by timeline (months and years).
3. Top 5 customers by revenue and sales quantity.
4. Top 5 products by revenue.
_This project will help him get his answers._
## Tackle the problem
### Visualize the data
Visualizing can be useful for making business decisions. The data visualization tool I would use is Tableau for making the overview dashboard. Making the dashboard clean and specific will help save time and resources.
